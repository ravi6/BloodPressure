This is an attempt to see the behaviour of 
level shifter when 5V TTL logic chips output
is fed to 3.3V CMOS chip.
It proved to be hard to get all of spice directives
from schematic. 
So initially used the netlist from schematic.
The spice net produced is heavily modified especially
for the Mosfet. 
Took a while to understand how spice works.
Tried arbitray digital signal cycle with piece wise linear
voltage source. First cycle works well, but second cycle
rise/fall times don't agree why???
