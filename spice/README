This is an attempt to see the behaviour of 
level shifter when 5V TTL logic chips output
is fed to 3.3V CMOS chip.
It proved to be hard to get all of spice directives
from schematic. 
So initially used the netlist from schematic.
The spice net produced is heavily modified especially
for the Mosfet. 
Took a while to understand how spice works.
Tried arbitray digital signal cycle with piece wise linear
voltage source. First cycle works well, but second cycle
rise/fall times don't agree why???

Well that is because I was setting time step to zero instead
of some finite value in .trans directive. I thought it was
initial time. The first parameter is time step, second end time.

Anway after a lot mucking around, figured the way to
do everything from gschem. It is relatively straigth forward now
that I know how to do it.

The confusion was more with Mosfet. First refq should have M as
starting. The type attribute tells something about the device type too.
Model Name is the name given to the model when the generic model is given
specific parameters. This then can be used with many of the instances of
that device with the same model parameters. (Key point to rememeber)

Model attribue is really .... single string where model parameters can
be specified.
